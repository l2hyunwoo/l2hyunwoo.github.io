# Building a Modern Blog with Next.js

Next.js has become the go-to framework for building modern web applications. In this post, we'll explore how to create a blog using Next.js and React.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several benefits for building blogs:

1. **Static Generation**: Pre-render pages at build time
2. **Server Components**: Reduce client-side JavaScript
3. **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization
4. **Fast Refresh**: Quick development experience

## Code Example

```tsx
export default function BlogPost() {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>My First Post</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my blog!</p>
    </article>
  );
}
```
